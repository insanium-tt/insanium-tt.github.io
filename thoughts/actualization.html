I've been a fan of CGP grey a while. He has this video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&pp=ygUfY2dwIGdyZXkgbmV3IHllYXIncyByZXNvbHV0aW9uIA%3D%3D" target="_blank">"your theme"</a>, that proposes replacing your new years resolution with a "theme" for the year. Last year, I subscribed to that idea. My theme was "the year of focus," and I would say I was moderately successful. 
<br> 
<br> 
I have spent the year learning, observing. Although I intend to learn and grow throughout my life, it is time for me to focus on doing more. It is time for me to actualize on my knowledge. 
<br> 
<br> 
<h4>Power</h4> 
So, if I wish to  <i>actualize</i>  with the end-goal of accomplishing my ambitions, I think it's implicit I think deeply about how my public perception and how I wield my power. This implicit from the fact that my ambitions inherently require navigating institutional and social structure to some extend. I have to think more deeply about how I communicate, how I'm perceived, etc. 
<br> 
<br> 
Obviously I shouldn't get super wrapped up in my own public perception. It's unhealthy, as any high schooler would tell you! But, like any part of my life, how I present myself requires deliberation, thought, and curation to maximize effectiveness. 
<br> 
<br> 
This leaves the question: how do I curate my public image to maximize my  <i>power?</i>  There are books on this sort of thing, e.g., 48 laws of power. I observe very very closely what makes others powerful and successful. It's time for me to start superimposing what I have learned onto my own life. Of course, I want to be subtle and not fucking stupid with it. Power, in general, is curated extremely in extremely subtle ways.
