Recently, I have been grateful to have been offered two excellent opportunities. I won't go into details of what those activities are (as that would be a bit of a dox), but what I will say is these offers are coveted and "prestigious." One is in industry, another is in academia. Admittedly I've realized that people work their entire lives and fail to achieve what I have achieved in such a short period. I'm ahead of the game, I guess. I dunno how to feel about that.
<br> 
<br> 
The reality of my life is I put up an veneer of deep strength and resilience, yet the full detail of my life is obscured from the average onlooker. It's not that I intentionally obscure my sins. It's just... why would my sins come up in average conversation? I would never bring such things up willingly. Thus, no one knows I'm disgusting. Yet, I've seemingly achieved success in my career. How am I supposed to feel? Despite being a horrible person, I have been offered a choice people much more genuine and who work much harder than me will never see. That's not to say I didn't work hard. I did. God knows I fucking did. Of course, I had good fortune along the way, just as I had bad.
<br> 
<br> 
I also recognize everyone has their own internal demons, and I'm probably not special. I guess it's partially because I've gotten very good at reading very deep into people, and I intentionally put myself around deeply genuine people. I can't help but to see some of my closest friends and think to myself, "wow, this person has certainly never hurt people like I have. that's  <i>crazy</i>"
<br> 
<br> 
Of course, I won't let my past failures keep me from doing as best as I can onto others. As I pursue my career, I'll seek to be genuine in the way I wish I was in the past.
