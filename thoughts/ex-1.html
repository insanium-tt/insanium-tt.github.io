On the ex.
<br> 
<br> 
My relationship with my ex was the deepest, most comprehensive relationship I've had my entire life. She knew the inner workings of my mind better than anyone, and we were indescribably close. And, I fucked it all up. 
<br> 
<br> 
I accept that this has happened. I now have no choice but to move forward. 
<br> 
<br> 
Over the past few months I've gotten to know many different people, a few of which may have potential as a future partner. But, I can't help but look at them as more shallow versions of my ex. Something about how my ex's mind worked simply isn't replicable. Does this mean I'm not over her? 
<br> 
<br> 
To better contextualize this issue, understand the following. I view myself as goddamnned crazy. Not a single person I know illustrates such towering depth to their own mind. I'm highly eccentric, and pretty layered. I'd imagine getting to know me must be a crazy fucking experience. 
<br> 
<br> 
Whenever I'm talking with a girl where there's clear mutual interest, our interactions will go like this. 
<br> 
<br> 
She'll sit down, maybe a little closer than normal friends would. I'll relax and give the conversation reigns to her. I like listening to other people talk. She's hold eye contact with me, smile, and talk about whatever makes her happy. I feel happy too, but only at a shallow level. Her eyes will gleam. We continue talking, maybe even for hours, and that shallowness tugs on my consciousness. Is she really capable of handling all of me? Would she be happy knowing all of me? Would I be happy? Would that happiness even come close to last time?
