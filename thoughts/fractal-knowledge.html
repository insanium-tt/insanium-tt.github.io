I have a profusely difficult time managing the fractal nature of knowledge. I am interested in it all. I want to learn it all, I want to do it all. I am in love with learning, and in love with growing myself. It's just so hard to limit myself.

<br> 
In university I have pursued such a wild level of both breadth and depth. There is just so goddamn much to computer science and technology in general, and every fucking ounce has the potential to captivate me.

<br> 
I wish to become a Renaissance Man, in a sense, for technology. Yet, I recognize the endlessly fractal nature and thus the impossible nature of the task. On a similar note, to succeed in the world requires focus, but my desire for enjoyment and fun leads me to learning anything about everything. Is the latter not the beauty of humanity?
