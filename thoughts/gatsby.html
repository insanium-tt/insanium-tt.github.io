I watched The Great Gatsby on the plane. Funnily enough I watched the movie instead of sleeping, so I'll be spilling the problem out to my friend who I'm visiting while half asleep. Maybe we can go to his favorite coffee shop, on me. 
<br> 
<br> 
Anyways, the movie. I watched the movie and read the book in early highschool, and it shaped my opinion on money and societal classes for sure. Why strive so hard to close the seemingly unclosable gap in familial prestige? I saw no purpose, but Gatsby sure did lol. 
<br> 
<br> 
Now that I watched the movie again, the biggest gripe I had was daisy seemingly being portrayed as a character without agency. She played the whims of her wealthy husband and Gatsby, and had seemingly no desire to change the world around her. That's no way to live. How selfish. Gatsby, similarly, was only selfless for the girl; a means to a self serving end. In a way, watching this loosely refined what I prefer in relationships. I guess the movie is idealized. 
<br> 
<br> 
An interesting modern contrast to The Great Gatsby is Love is War (yes, the fucking anime). Love is War, as opposed to the great Gatsby, is way less idealized and much more personal to the characters while still playing nicely the class struggle. Dare I say, love is war is a fair but more realistic.
