godless technology. God's kingdom does not allow for the absolute understanding of said kingdom, for if we know the true nature of how God rules over us, any reasonable person would rebel. If God values his throne in heaven, he will do everything in his power to prevent humanity from ascending outselves. And thus, it is in his interest to design a universe which we cannot understand with mathematical absolution. 
<br> 
<br> 
I will define the Godless Technology conjecture: A computer with the ability to simulate the universe in its atomical entirety requires more than all the atoms in the universe to construct. 
<br> 
<br> 
A problem with this conjecture is that I am not a physicist. Another problem is that, even if this conjecture were to be true, we do not necessarily require a total simulation of the universe in order to achieve a  <i>strong</i>  understanding of it. 
<br> 
<br> 
I'll be continuing to think about ways God could fundamentally limit our ability to explore the nature of the universe. An idea is the constants of nature - if we tune the constants just right, what becomes impossible? What becomes possible?
