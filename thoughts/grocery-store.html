Every Sunday morning this past semester, I biked 20 minutes into essentially the hood to get groceries. I looked forward to this trip every single week. I've come to notice my environment is filled to the brim with exceptionally ambitious, high-achieving people. 
<br> 
<br> 
But, at this grocery store, I see true normalcy. I see people from every walk of life. I like it that way. It's genuine in a way I can't really describe. On a given day I'll see kids shopping with their parents, old couples, people clearly down on their luck, etc etc. It's a nice getaway from my typical environment. 
<br> 
<br> 
The environment in the grocery store is just... sweet. Whenever I make eye contact with someone, I like to smile at them. And, they smile back! It's a warm and genuine environment. The store is clearly staffed with illegal immigrants working at an extremely low pay. But, everyone seems happy to be there. It's down to earth in a refreshing way. Everyone seems happy to be alive and existing in this world. 
<br> 
<br> 
Sorry if this post sounds stupid. I don't really know how to turn my thoughts into words.
