I would describe myself as constantly in my own head. My mind is almost always running. So much to do, so much to learn, all the time.
<br> 
<br> 
I build up towering fantasies in my own mind. A world under the sheets. My mind tends to obsess over a single fantasy or topic for a few weeks, always coming back to it in moments between the action. The second I even think about formalizing it, either in a note or somewhere else, my mind will move onto the next.
<br> 
<br> 
Although I know quantifying the chaos of one's own mind is futile, it's neat recognizing patterns here and there.
