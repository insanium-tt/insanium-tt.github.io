I deeply desire to be close to someone else, but whenever I do so I feel the inexplicable desire to spew the my every chaotic thought at them. I feel, in order to be as close to someone as I can be, they should be intimately familiar with the machinations of my inner self. I have built for myself a vast internal architecture of interior thought, and the closest thing I could describe as true love would be to show my other as much of it as possible. 
<br> 
<br> 
But, I've come to realize I'm alone in this respect. No one even thinks about relationships at such a level of depth. Furthermore, I'm a disgusting, imperfect human with an uncountable number of flaws, so achieving this indescribably comprehensive relationship I deeply desire will be a lifelong challenge. I have learned tom compensate, to some degree. To my own surprise I've become exceptional at navigating social scenarios. I've learned to efficiently search through bodies of people to find those who are interesting to me. Perhaps what I desire is not just unique to me, and I will find what I'm looking for.
<br> 
<br> 
How do I even know if the person I found is even worthy of peering into the depths of my mind? I don't have the energy to repeatedly delve into my internal structures and try to convey their meaning to an outsider. There's also the practical problem of maintaining a relationship. When interacting with others, one must maintain a proper dynamic - conversation flow, balance, maintaining interest, etc. 
<br> 
<br> 
I've only had one experience spewing forth my internal structures and systems onto someone I haven't known for long, and although she excitedly engaged with it for a little while, things quickly fell off from the onset. I've come to realize she was full of issues herself, and although she excitedly engaged she didn't necessarily fall in love with my internal structures. I mean, how could anyone fall in love with my deeply flawed mind? On a simpler note, enticing someone into a relationship seems to take maintaining a level of mystery about yourself, as well as maintaining a notion of progress and pace. This is quite hard to do if I just dump all my cards on the table from the start. It seems I'm forced to take a chance.
<br> 
<br> 
Similarly, I'm no stranger to maintaining long-term relationships. Relationship maintenance at a certain level of depth in connection is an extremely challenging task - one of which I certainly am yet to master.  
<br> 
<br> 
I also recognize I struggle with deep internal conflicts that, when in a long term relationship, I am hesitant to bring up with my partner. This can create a wedge. I want to face the world with someone, but I also want to be fiercely independent. I go through cycles of intense self-hate, and at times I have a deep desire to be violently torn down by those closest to me. But at the same time, I'm soft. I want to be close and affectionate with my partner. I want deep intimacy, but I don't want comfort.
