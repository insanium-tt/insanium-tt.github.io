I have owned my x1 carbon gen 6 for over 6 years. It died today. Even though it was just a laptop, it meant the world to me. It has seen me through triumph and tragedy. It has been my rock. My thinkpad has grown with me over the years, moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10 to many different Linux distributions. It has been with me to dozens of countries, and it has carried me through highschool and most of a hellish university degree. Without it, I don't think I would have gotten anywhere close to where I am today. 
<br> 
<br> 
Admittedly, I'm attached to my laptop. I mean, I've had it for 6 fucking years. What else has remained constant in my life over the last 6 years? Legitimately, it's just my laptop and my one (cute) stuffed animal. I've been through so much with the damn thing. 
<br> 
<br> 
Regrettably, I feel bad about how I treated it. I banged on the keys. I dropped my pen countless times on its chassis while practicing pen spinning. I threw it around in my bag. Yet, it worked so well for so long. Through every tragedy I've been through, every breakup, every failure, every rejection, all the fucking bullshit, my laptop has remained steadfast. I really don't deserve it. God, I'm crying while writing this. Fucking dammit. What the fuck is wrong with me? 
<br> 
<br> 
In all honesty I don't need much compute. 16gb of ram and a semi-new i7 is enough for me, as through research and all I have access to powerful remote servers. I'll get another x1 carbon; I'm too attached to the form factor. I'm too attached to the little intricacies of the design. This time, I'll treat my laptop better. This time, I'll be better. I fucking swear on it.
