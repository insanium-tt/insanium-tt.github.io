Scientific research is a highly nepotistic field. There are countless studies supporting this claim. In my experience, this absolutely holds up; whenever I meet a cracked undergraduate researcher, it is almost always the case they extremely well-connected and had a stable home throughout their childhood. That's not to say I wasn't fortunate myself - I just didn't have a great childhood to go on to become a top researcher. Unfortunately, we live in a highly competitive world, and research is no different. So, how the fuck do I compete with people who have an inherent advantage over me?
<br> 
<br> 
Even when advantages aren't inherent, even when the person worked their fucking ass off to become the best person they could be, how the fuck do I compete with that too? 
<br> 
<br> 
<h2>First Principle: Environment</h2> 
If I identify someone with extreme skill, I will make them my friend and hang around them, even if I don't get along super well with them. (Although I've noticed, I almost always get along very very well with people I identify as highly skilled). That is, I never push someone I am "competing" with away. I always keep them close, as to learn from them.
<br> 
<br> 
<h2>Second Principle: Extraction</h2> 
Once I'm in the vicinity of someone who I wish to learn from, the process of actually doing so is extremely nontrivial. I don't really have an answer of how to best do this, as I've only spent about two years thinking in depth about this sort of thing. But, I would generally classify the process into two steps: observation, and implementation.    
<br> 
<br> 
I observe people with the goal of picking up on small, key tidbits of knowledge they possess, interesting habits they have, and little tricks they employ. Most of the things I pick up from those I observe are extremely small in detail (yet I recognize, many of these small details is what makes someone successful in the first place.) 
<br> 
<br> 
Picking up on this sort of thing requires observing someone extremely closely for a long period of time. Ideally, you're able to observe that person in many different scenarios, you're able to see them struggle, etc.
<br> 
<br> 
For example, when observing a leader, I tend to pick up on the small interpersonal tricks they do in order to guide their team in the right direction. Or more nefariously, the subtle things they do to enforce their dominance or manipulate their teammates.
<br> 
<br> 
When observing a speaker, I pay extreme attention to the structure of their sentences, their word choice, their body language, their everything. If I felt strong emotion from one of their lines, I break down why exactly I felt that. Was it the tone of their voice? Their body language? The image they conjured in my head with their previous words?
<br> 
<br> 
Also, I write down many many notes for myself. I am a highly prolific note-writer. I've considered having pages in my notes dedicated to individual people, but I haven't gone that far yet. Seems kinda creepy.
<br> 
<br> 
<h2>Third Principle: Superimposition</h2> 
So, after spending some time observing interesting or successful people, how do I go about implementing their processes into my own life? 
<br> 
<br> 
First, I recognize I need to be significantly well-reflected. What are my processes, currently? What's good about my processes? Where do my processes fall short? Answering these questions often requires revisiting them semi-often. I kinda implicitly do this as I learn and grow.  
<br> 
<br> 
Second, I need to  <i>superimpose</i>  the processes of others onto my own life. That is, how do I best alter my own processes according to the processes of others? If that's using a piece of software, how do I incorporate this software into my workflow? Stuff like this. In my opinion, the skill of  <i>process superimposition</i>  is something you develop slowly over your whole life. Try to implement someone else's process, and see how it feels. Iterate. It takes time!
