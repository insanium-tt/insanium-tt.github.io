Following my breakup in August, I have entered a period of intense self-reflection and a deep loneliness. I haven't felt anything like this before, and I feel the ramifications of this time period will have an intense effect on the rest of my life.
<br> 
<br> 
For the past 5 years, in one way or another, I've had someone who I could confide in, someone who I can be close to. Someone I could share all the stupid details of my life with, someone who I can truly be myself around. But now, I have no one. All my thoughts are trapped in my head, with no one to hear them but myself.
<br> 
<br> 
During my breakup, I was in another country where I knew very few people. I worked in a lab, so I got to know some of the grad students and professors a little bit. Yet, despite my isolation, I didn't feel so lonely. I felt content on my own, doing my own thing. Perhaps that was temporary and not of general significance, as it was too close to my breakup. 
<br> 
<br> 
Upon coming back home and re-entering a normal social life, I've felt more lonely than ever. I'm surrounded by people I know, yet I'm close to none of them. I have good friends I deeply trust, but nothing like the relationship with my ex. Being surrounded by less than desirable relationships is a constant reminder of what I once had. 
<br> 
<br> 
I know so many damn people would be satisfied with my situation. Because, in all honesty, my social life is pretty good. But, of course, I'm not. I've been given a taste of what a truly deep, comprehensive relationship is like. And, now that I don't have something like that anymore, I'm left with a big, gaping hole in my heart that yearns to be filled. Maybe if I knew what I knew now, I wouldn't have let myself fuck up my past relationships. It's not worth crying over spilt milk, I guess.
<br> 
<br> 
It's been a couple months since that breakup, and I'm feeling a little better now. Maybe I could try dating again. In all honesty I've had my eye on someone who I want to get to know better. Either way, no matter who I end up with next, I will constantly remind myself of the way I've felt now. Hopefully reminding myself of the deep loneliness I feel now will help me better handle future relationships. Maybe, just maybe, I could make someone happy. To do so, I fucking swear I'll become the best goddamn person I can be.
