I am needlessly addicted to the feeling I get when interacting with close friends. I am in constant need of socialization and "being talked to" by someone. Is this some disgusting sociopathic thing? I can rarely spend time just on my own, in solace, unless I am being pre-occupied by some activity. 
<br> 
<br> 
I don't know if all humans are like this, or this is simply the product of living in a modern era filled to the goddamn brim with stimulation. It's not like I use social media either - I rarely, if ever use social media. I am an active user on instant messaging services. Yet, my addiction persists. When I'm not actively talking to someone else, or there are no messages I need to read, I feel so goddamn lonely. It's so fucked. I constantly resist the urge to constantly check my messages. 
<br> 
<br> 
I don't feel like I need a relationship to survive; rather, it's the deep and existential fear of being alone for goddamn eternity. This is profusely hypocritical of me. I've cut away people from my life who could have eternally prevented such a loneliness, yet I cannot help feeling this way.
