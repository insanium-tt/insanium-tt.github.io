I want to become a fucking machine. I want to spend every single goddamn second I'm awake pursuing my ambitions. I do not want emotion. I do not want friendship. I only desire the absolutism of my inner mechanics. I do not seek to understand, as I am not a thinking machine. I simply act according to my circuitry and programming. I am not shaken, I am not phased. My own existence is in absolute servitude to those around me. The happiness of others is genuine, my own happiness is an illusion. Push on me, and I will not fall over. I am resolute in my path through existence, as I know nothing else but forward.
