When I think of form in mathematics, I think of the structure of a proof, the structure of a mathematical argument, or some sort of beautiful line of thinking that led to an answer. As such, form in mathematics is obviously a very subjective thing. Nonetheless, I've grown quite fond of the notion of good mathematical form. 
<br> 
I've gained an intuition of mathematical form mostly by closely observing those who are better at math than me. I'm extremely grateful to have the opportunity to consistently observe people with extreme talent for mathematics. I'm talking IMO-level. Something about the flow of their mathematical arguments rings beauty. It's almost indescribable.

There is some sort of separation between my love of form, and me actually doing mathematics. When I read old proofs of mine, I see how rigid rough they are. My old proofs and mathematical arguments just don't flow. My new arguments aren't much better either. Observing those who I feel  <i>do</i>  have mathematical form makes me extremely aware of what I lack.

Mathematical form is pretty. It's nice.
