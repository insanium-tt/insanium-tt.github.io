When I think of form in mathematics, I think of the structure of a proof, the structure of a mathematical argument, or some sort of beautiful line of thinking that led to an answer. As such, form in mathematics is obviously a very subjective thing. Nonetheless, I've grown quite fond of the notion of good mathematical form. 
<br> 
Despite this, there is some sort of separation between my love of form, and me actually doing mathematics. When I read old proofs of mine, I see how rigid rough they are. My old proofs and mathematical arguments just don't flow. My new arguments aren't much better either.

I believe there is a profound beauty in  <i>form</i>, and I've grown to be quite fond of the notion of good form, especially in mathematics.
