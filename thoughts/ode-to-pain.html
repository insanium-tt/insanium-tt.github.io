I love putting my body though indescribable pain. I love getting on my bike and petalling until my muscles seize and cease to function. The numbness I feel from the constantl electrochemical stimulatino surging from my nerves to my brain is a deeply calming sensation, almost nostalgic. It's intoxicating.
<br> 
<br> 
I've come to hate the fact that my body is an ever-improving machine. It takes more and more time to push my body into a state of absolute collapse. It's not fair - I crave that pain, that sense of despiration. No amount of self harm, no amount of psycological torture, no amount of existential error, can equate to the feeling of pushing my body to its goddamned limit.
<br> 
<br> 
There is an inherent beauty in suffering that does not exist in any other facet of human existence.
