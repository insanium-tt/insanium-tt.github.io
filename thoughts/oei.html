Check out Reed Oei. <a href="https://www.reedoei.com/" target="_blank">reedoei.com</a>.
<br> 
<br> 
He died from cancer in 2022. He was just 23. 
<br> 
<br> 
He was extremely passionate about formal methods, as extremely evident by his reddit post history and research track record. I know about his death for a long while, but recently it's been affecting more. 
<br> 
<br> 
I've been following his work since about 2020, and his work had a significant impact on the direction of my career. He inspired me, and yet he had no idea I exist. I dug up a draft of an email I almost sent to him in 2021 today, asking about some of his older work. Rereading that email draft really, really hurt. I wish I sent it. I wish I wasn't so dumb. 
<br> 
<br> 
His last project was an automatic theorem prover, Pecan, using Buchi automata as types. See: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01727.pdf" target="_blank">arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01727.pdf</a>. I had a casual conversation with a research collaborator about Pecan a while back. Its performance was sluggish. That's because the language inclusion problem, i.e. L(A) \subseteq L(B) is PSPACE-complete. 
<br> 
<br> 
I'm currently developing heuristics to decide language inclusion quickly. If I can implement some good heuristics, Pecan would be much quicker, and therefore be able to automatically prove more interesting things.
<br> 
<br> 
You know, It fucking huts so much knowing that Reed will never know his work directly inspired mine. Reading his reddit posts, reading his papers, reading the descriptions on his projects, reading the comments on his code, he bled passion. I see a lot of myself in him. It hurts knowing his career was cut short. This sounds stupid in writing, but I hope to complete my heuristics and lead a successful career in his honor. I know that's what Reed would have wanted anyways. 
<br> 
<br> 
Some additional thoughts:
<br> 
<li>Looking back, I deeply regret not sending that email. Today, whenever I find someone cool or interesting, I force myself to email them, even though part of me dreads the weight of the additional social interaction. </li> 
 
<li>Reed's death has been seeping into my mind at some of the low points in my career. Sure, whatever I'm going through may suck, but I'm alive. I'm still kicking, and I will still be kicking until I drop. Thinking about the guy sometimes gives me just a little bit of a boost to keep going.</li> 
 
<li>My research collaborator brought up Pecan and Reed's work too casually. He didn't even mention Reed's death. He might not even have known. I don't think he should be burdened to look into every single one of the authors of the papers he reads, but still...</li>
