<h4>Intro</h4> 
I am deeply driven to shape the world to my vision. To do so, I recognize I must become the best possible person I can be. How the fuck do I do that? 
<br> 
<br> 
One of the best ways of improving myself, I've come to realize, is learning directly from those better than myself. Over the past few years, I have had the extreme privilege of rubbing elbows with truly incredible people. Naturally, I compare myself to these people. I ask myself, why am I not as good as them? What do they have that I don't? And, how can I gain the skills and knowledge they have? To answer these questions, I've thought deeply about  <i>intrinsic inequality</i>  between peoples. 
<br> 
<br> 
<h4>On Privilege</h4> 
Of the above questions, I would say I've thought most about what I have, what I don't have, and how what I have compares to others. 
<br> 
<br> 
I'm grateful to have lived an eventful life thus far. I've done a lot, and I've learned a lot. However, in terms of resources (mostly socioeconomic, social, and familial), I would say I'm pretty average. This notion is better contextualized when I compare myself with those I perceive to be better than me. I'm attending a strong American university, and thus I'm surrounded by ambitious people. Looking into the backgrounds of my peers can be incredibly disheartening at times.
<br> 
<br> 
I often see they have long family lineages of wealth and power. More often than not, their parents are still together and both pursue extremely high value careers. Almost always, they attended an elite private highschool whose resources far outweigh the resources of even my local college. Although I rarely have the full details behind someone's personal lives, more often than not I've seen stable conditions at home.
<br> 
<br> 
I have none of this. And yet, I share the same ambitions as these people. How the fuck do I compete with them? Well, what did all this privilege grant this arbitrary "peer" I've synthesized? First and foremost, wealth and access. They can purchase almost anything, and if they need access to some person, institution, or organization, they can get it via some connection. Second, and most importantly, they have more knowledge and information available to them.
<br> 
<br> 
I've generally managed to overcome the wealth and access inequality via various means. But, the informational inequality... it's hard lol
<br> 
<br> 
<h4>Informational Inequality</h4> 
Beyond tangible wealth and connections, privilege grants vast information and knowledge. The gap between having knowledge and not having knowledge is, in general, much harder to close. You simply don't know what you don't know. I've come to realize this informational inequality comes in so many fucking forms. I think of the impoverished who don't understand banking systems, those who don't have access to the internet, those living in authoritarian countries with censorship, those who have been fed propaganda their entire lives. On the other hand, I think of family dynasties that have rich knowledge of corporate structure and tax evasion, children of elite families that have been trained since the day they were born to excel in math and science, students who went to elite private schools.  
<br> 
<br> 
<h4>How I fill the gaps</h4> 
Informational inequality, in comparison to wealth and access inequality, is a lot less straightforward to close. To fill the gaps, I find there are two parts. First, identify those who know what you want to know. Second, extract. 
<br> 
<br> 
In general, placing yourself in an environment where you can consistently learn from those you identify as knowing information you want to know is deeply challenging. It's in a similar vein to access inequality. Although I don't think I should speak specifically about how I've placed myself around those who I seek to learn from, I will say this: many elite universities fail to lock (or sufficiently secure) their doors ;)
<br> 
<br> 
Now, you've figured out how to consistently place yourself around those who you seek to learn from. How the fuck do you extract knowledge from them, especially if it's in something like mathematics, science, or research? This is a pretty hard question to answer imo, but here's my take.  
<br> 
<br> 
To learn from someone exceptional requires paying extreme attention from the subtle things they do. Pay attention to their processes, pay attention to the little things. What connections do they make? What resources are they referencing? Gaining an intuition for how someone accomplishes what you want to accomplish is critical. Being able to superimpose their processes onto your life is an entire other skill, but that's to be talked about sometime in the future.
