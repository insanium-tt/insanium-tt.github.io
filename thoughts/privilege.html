One thing that I have noticed attending a strong American university and pursuing research is the extremely high level of informational inequality. Looking into the backgrounds of my colleagues can be quite discouraging at times. I've seen long family lineages of scientists, private high schools that offer higher level math classes than my local community college, and of course those with classical financial privilege. I have none of that. How the fuck am I supposed to compete with people that have such a background?

To make it clear, this won't be a "fuck the system" type of post. Rather, I'd like to speak towards my experience largely overcoming the informational inequality I experienced.
