Rain.
<br> 
<br> 
You stuff your scattered notebooks and worn computing equipment into your backpack. Despite the late hour, you feel the hum of activity as you stride down the institute's hallway. The pursuit of truth takes no breaks; everyone around you silently acknowledges the finiteness of their lives and works in fervor. Yet, you recognize you are not a machine, and optimizing your output requires rest. Still, your mind churns. 
<br> 
<br> 
You make your way to the exitway and peer through the windowed doors; the city you know is baked in a familiar darkness, and rain patters the ground. The sight makes your mind falls silent, just for a moment. You adjust your jacket, then brave the outside. You have somewhere to be.
<br> 
<br> 
You wind down the empty city streets on your bike. No sane person would be out this late, in this weather. The roar of the rain makes itself known to you; it slams into your face and penetrates into your mind. The dreary night bleeds into you. Your mind races between your work and your surroundings. Your thoughts grow darker. The city is shit, the world is shit, everything is shit. Paying such close attention to your surroundings reminds you of the failures of the institutions that govern your life. Why do you persist, you ask yourself. Your find yourself pedaling over a bridge, and you peer over the side of the overpass. Why not here? Why not now? One turn and it's over. You push the thoughts down. 
<br> 
<br> 
You find your way to a towering white brick building. You turn your gaze upwards, the rain beating down on your face, seeping through the seams of your jacket and down your neck. Your eyes wander up the building, counting the stories. You spot a warm glow escaping a single window. Your heart lets out a sigh of relief. You push the entranceway door open and a familiar off-white light floods your surroundings. You enter. 
<br> 
<br> 
The familiar routine of locking up your bike and stepping into the same elevator brings a familiar ease to your busy mind. You stand in front of your apartment door. For just another moment, your mind pauses. The thoughts by the overpass return to you, and you ask yourself, again, why do you persist? Why. Not. Now. You push the door open; the exact arc and the circumferential force of the door's swing are etched into your dopamine receptors. Your universe, your happiness.
<br> 
<br> 
You spot her sitting cross-legged on the couch, wearing her favorite skin-tight jeans and a tee shirt you're sure she fished out of your hamper. Her worn laptop, an two empty coffee mugs, and various papers, notebooks, and stationary litter the wooden coffee table. Her gaze is deep into some academic paper she's holding much too close to her face. She is living in her own world, and pursuing her own truths in parallel to yours. She tilts her head back, away from her paper, meeting your gaze; her eyes show such deep exhaustion, yet profuse a strength indescribable with words. In that moment, you cannot fathom anything more beautiful. You strip your coat and join her.
<br> 
<br> 
Her body melts into yours. Your skin, still cold to the touch, kisses the soft denim of her jeans and the cotton of her tee-shirt. She wraps her arms around your neck and gently pushes her face into your chest. Your hand makes its way down her side, setting on her lower back. Your other hand gently cups her chin and tilts her head upwards. Her loving eyes meet yours, and her smile warms every crevice of your heart. Once again, the churning of your mind ceases, and you question whether this moment is perfect. As you look into her eyes, the thoughts of the overpass seep into your mind again. But this time, you remember why you persist through a life you perceive to be hellish at times.
<br> 
<br> 
As she drifts into sleep, the rain pattering on the window fills the silence. The rising and falling of her chest, gently pushing into yours, brings ease to your mind. Slowly, you drift off too. Maybe the rain isn't so bad.
