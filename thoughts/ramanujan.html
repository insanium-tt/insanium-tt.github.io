Recently I've been entirely captivated by the idea of intuition, and particularly intuition in mathematics. Unlike all other facets of human knowledge, mathematics is absolute in its correctness, perfect in its structure. So, intuition in the field just has a unique flavor. The space of reasoning you navigate while reasoning about math is unique in its raw symbolic-ness. 
<br> 
<br> 
How intuition is developed is such a fucking fascinating process to me. I so closely observe the talented people around me, and observing their intuition and refining my own is an addicting process. One mathematician, however, completely stands out to me. Ramanujan could be described as the most intuition-heavy mathematician in fucking history. 
<br> 
<br> 
In honor of Pi day (3/14!), I've been reading Ramanujan's papers and whatnot. His work, and the way he was perceived by his main collaborator, GH Hardy, fucking fascinates me. For example, his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato_series" target="_blank">infinite series for pi</a> just blows my mind. And to think, he  <i>intuited</i>  that, he just shit it out, is completely stunning and extremely beautiful to me. His mastery over continued fractions and infinite series is truly unmatched. I don't even have the words.
<br> 
<br> 
To quote Ramanujan, the Hindu goddess Namagiri would visit him in his sleep and give him the answers. He did the whole feynman thing where he looked at the problem, thought about it super hard, and the answer would just... appear. Is that not beautiful? Is that not fucking incredible, that the human mind can do such a thing? For whatever reason knowing such a thing is possible makes me so grateful to be alive. I share the world with such amazing people. My mathematical intuition may never reach such heights. I am not special. I am not unique. However, I can absolutely observe and appreciate the process of mathematical discovery.
