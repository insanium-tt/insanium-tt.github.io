Every day, I get in my reps. If I want to achieve the optimal self, it is not sufficient to depend on how I feel to do reps. Every day, I do my reps. Every day, I pursue the topics I need to master. 
<br> 
<br> 
Reps are the units of my mastery. A rep is defined as 50 minutes of work followed by a 10 minute break. The quality of reps matter too. How focused was I? How much volume of work did I get done? Did I focus on a singular task, or did I do multiple? I truly am pedantic about my own reps. 
<br> 
<br> 
Reps are optimal for maximizing my own output, but at the same time they also put an indescribable drain on me. The structure, the repetitiveness, the monotony - reps can feel sisyphean at times. To compensate, I try to minimize the importance of the reps themselves, while at the same time still adhering to their structure. It's the work I'm trying to achieve, not maximizing some arbitrary number.
<br> 
<br> 
I look forward to eroding at the structure of the rep in my near future. 
<br> 
<br> 
I once did 27 reps sequentially. It was not so great.
