It's been growing warmer recently. I've always loved to take nighttime walks during this time of year, but recently I've taken up a new tradition. After a few months of practicing my lockpicking skills, I'm able to consistently pick locks in the wild. A nice perk of this is, with a little planning, I'm able to get onto the rooftop of whatever building I please. This has birthed a nice little tradition. There's a certain building at my university that I know how to access 24/7, and whose roof I can also consistently access. Whenever I'm feeling down or stressed, I'll go there. It's a nice way to get away from my own life for a bit. I'll usually go up there to think, but I'll sometimes bring a book.

Looking over the city from atop that building feels unreal; the city that I love, the city that gave me all I have, entirely visible to my naked eye with no windows or obstructions in between. It's peaceful and lovely. Maybe whenever I'm next talking to a girl, I'll take her up there and play I-spy with her.
