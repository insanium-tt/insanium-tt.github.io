This semester, emotionally, part 2. Like my last semester-emotional reflection, this is a companion to an academic reflection I wrote elsewhere. To preface, this was my best performing semester academically and arguably my best performing semester professionally.
<br> 
<br> 
Wow. What a fucking wild ride. I've barreled into the depths of loneliness and burnout. I've dug so deep into my personality and the way I act such that I can't even stand myself anymore. I'm a disgusting person. How am I supposed to hold any sort of confidence in myself at this point? I don't know how to rebuild myself, and I don't even feel comfortable reaching out for help to do so. The help sucks, and I don't think the "help" could help me. My only therapy is the words I desperately spew onto my notes. Truly, I'm grasping at straws here.
<br> 
<br> 
I'm less focused than ever. I'm less driven than ever. Yet, my responsibilities continue to grow. I need to frequently remind myself that the only reason I'm putting myself through a hellish undergrad is because I  <i>fucking</i>  love what I do. I constantly remind myself of the journey I went through to discover my passions. I'm battling disillusionment and constantly refining my ambitions. I still think about my ex daily; I learned she decided to take a gap year to supposedly focus on school-tangential things (e.g. research and board exams), but I know the true reason is because her mental health must also be in the shitter. I can't blame her after what I did to her. 
<br> 
<br> 
I've realized I have a pretty nasty habit of seeking co-dependent relationships. Similarly I feel like I can push people away at times, and that no one really  <i>wants</i>  to talk to me (or even thinks about me at all for that matter). I am constantly surprised that people say good things about me when I'm not around. If I die, I feel as if I'll be forgotten about in a week. Why do I even give a fucking shit about my legacy?
<br> 
<br> 
I recognize that I  <i>should</i>  be living for myself, but that's hard. I have no self-confidence. I have image issues. Every action reminds me of my past mistakes. I don't know what depression feels like, but how I feel now feels kind of close. Nevertheless, I'm going to keep persisting and trying to do my best. I have to, right? What other choice do I have in this meaningless desert of existence?
