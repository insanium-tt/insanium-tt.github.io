This semester, emotionally. A companion to my more academic reflection I wrote somewhere else.
<br> 
<br> 
This past semester has been extremely interesting emotionally. For the first time in a long time, I can say I genuinely have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with my life. While I've been extremely successful academically, emotionally (on the back-end) things have been rough. 
<br> 
<br> 
I'm trying to find out what I want out of my life. I'm trying to figure out what I want relationship-wise and socially. I'm still fixing myself, and I don't think I'll ever stop. I'm trying to figure myself out, and I'm not even sure I'm making progress. Writing sometimes helps, but at the same time "making progress" emotionally is extremely hard to judge. 
<br> 
<br> 
Similarly, I'm still trying to cope with my past mistakes. I've made so many fucking mistakes throughout my life. I can't help but to look at myself with extreme horror and disgust. It hasn't helped that many of my friends I've put myself around are extremely pure, and thus their relationships are extremely wholesome. I know they will almost certainly never go through the struggles I went through. What to do, what to do...
