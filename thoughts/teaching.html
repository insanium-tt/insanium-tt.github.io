I've found myself in a position where many different people, many of whom I deeply respect, approach me for academic and personal advice. People which I perceive to be  <i>better than me</i>  in many different respects look to  <i>me</i>  of all people for advice on various things. How the fuck? For maybe the first time in my life I am feeling a large amount of imposter syndrome. I understand I do not need to be better than someone at anything to give effective advice; in general, I enjoy helping people and I think I'm at least decent at it. Yet, in a weird emotional way, I struggle to do so.
<br> 
<br> 
Those that entrust me with their insecurities and ask me for advice seem to perceive me very highly. I genuinely cannot comprehend how this can be. Okay, I understand this is a product of me keeping my sins hidden from everyone but myself, but understand how conflicting this feels for me. Those seeking my advice have no idea how flawed I truly am. They have no idea of the sins I've committed. They have no idea what a horrible, impure, disgusting person I am.
