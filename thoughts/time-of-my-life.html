I've been at an academic conference (in my city) this past week, and today I had a lovely conversation with this cute girl about our mutual areas of research interest. I happened to sit next to her while attending a fucking fantastic talk by a fucking fantastic academic, and we ended up initiating conversation afterwards. Afterwards we sat on a park bench and chatted for about an hour; as it turns out, her PhD advisor is my intended PhD advisor, and our research interests align super closely. We were both very excited about what each other had to say; I loved the way her eyes would sparkle whenever I mentioned certain topics. Obviously I'm not trying to fall for her or get with her or anything. It was just a nice interaction, and I'm happy that I've made a nice friend.

Afterwards, hyped up on happy chemicals, I took a slight joyride on my bike through the city instead of heading directly home. The weather was perfect, and I let the wind blow through my hair as I cycled no-handed through the city streets. I blasted Ken Ashcorp's song "In the Zone" the whole way and shamelessly sung along to the lyrics at points. I dunno.. I was just happy to be alive.

At the tail end of my cruise a question popped into my head: are these the best days of my life? Am I going to look back at this summer as the time of my life? In general we only recognize certain times good times in retrospect, right? So how am I supposed to know?

I guess from a sheer career perspective my trajectory has been an exponential curve upwards, but that's been the case for the past four years. Obviously my mental health has been pretty inconsistent over the past year, but I dunno. I think I'm enjoying the process a lot more, despite my fucking absurd workload. I guess I shouldn't think about it too deeply; I had a lovely time today cruising through the city singing along to a song about drawing porn, and I hope to have many more days like this in the future :)
