I made a cute observation about things while inebriated. There is no base unit of matter, and there is no base unit of time. Matter is uncountable, and time is uncountably precise. We can use function generators to generate an uncountable number of functions and reason about the universe that way, but is that really meaningful?

I've come to realize that all of science is an approximation. Physics hasn't seen a major breakthrough in say 30 years, and at the heart of computability theory exists many undecidable problems. We've seemed to hit the limit of truly deductive reasoning about the world around us. Kinda wild.
